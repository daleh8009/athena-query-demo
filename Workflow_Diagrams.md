    (1 min)      (3-5 days)     (2-4 hours)      (minutes)      (hours)   (finally!)
```

### AI-Driven Process (Green/Blue Theme):
```
Business User → Natural Language → AI Query Generator → Auto Execution → Instant Results
    (1 min)         (30 seconds)        (seconds)          (seconds)       (done!)
```

**Visual Elements:**
- Use icons: 👤 💬 🤖 ⚡ 📊

## Diagram 3: AIDLC Integration Model

### Traditional SDLC:
```
Requirements → Design → Code → Test → Deploy → Maintain
   (Weeks)     (Days)   (Days)  (Days)  (Hours)   (Ongoing)
```

### AI-Driven Development Lifecycle (AIDLC):
```
AI-Assisted Requirements → Smart Code Generation → Automated Testing → Intelligent Deployment
        (Hours)                   (Minutes)           (Automated)         (Self-Optimizing)
```

## Diagram 5: Business Impact Metrics

### Before vs. After Comparison:
```
BEFORE (Traditional):
📊 Query Request: 3-5 days
💰 IT Overhead: $2,100/query
👥 User Adoption: 20%
⏱️ Decision Speed: Weekly reports

AFTER (AI-Driven):
📊 Query Request: 30 seconds
💰 IT Overhead: $5/query
👥 User Adoption: 85%
⏱️ Decision Speed: Real-time insights
```

### ROI Calculation:
```
Annual Savings = (Traditional Cost - AI Cost) × Query Volume
$1.2M = ($2,100 - $5) × 600 queries/year

Time Savings = 99.8% reduction in query time
User Productivity = 300% increase in data usage
Decision Speed = Real-time vs. weekly (7,000% improvement)
```

**Visual Elements:**
- Use before/after comparison charts
- Include dollar signs and percentages
- Show dramatic improvements with visual emphasis

## PowerPoint Creation Tips:

### Slide Design:
- **Use consistent color scheme**: Blue/Green for positive, Red/Orange for problems
- **Include icons**: Use modern, flat design icons
- **Keep text minimal**: Let diagrams tell the story
- **Use animation**: Reveal process steps one by one

### Visual Hierarchy:
- **Titles**: Large, bold fonts
- **Key metrics**: Highlighted with color and size
- **Process flows**: Clear arrows and logical progression
- **Supporting text**: Smaller, consistent formatting

### Interactive Elements:
- **Clickable demo link** on final slide
- **QR code** for easy mobile access
- **Contact information** prominently displayed
- **Next steps** clearly outlined

### Speaker Notes Integration:
- **Include timing** for each slide
- **Add technical details** that don't fit on slide
- **Prepare for Q&A** with additional context
- **Have backup explanations** if demo fails
