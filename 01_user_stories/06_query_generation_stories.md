# Query Generation User Stories

## Epic: SQL Query Generation and Optimization

### Story 1: Natural Language to SQL Translation
**As a** business user  
**I want to** see my natural language question converted to SQL  
**So that** I can understand how my data request is being processed

### Story 5: Query Optimization Suggestions
**As a** business user  
**I want to** receive suggestions to improve query performance  
**So that** I can get results faster and reduce costs

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Automatic analysis of query performance characteristics
- Suggestions for adding filters to reduce data scanning
- Recommendations for using pre-aggregated tables when available
- Warnings about Cartesian products or missing JOIN conditions
- Cost estimates for query execution

**Optimization Areas:**
- **Partition Pruning:** Suggest date filters to limit data scanning
- **Index Usage:** Recommend filters that leverage existing indexes
- **Aggregation Efficiency:** Suggest using summary tables for common calculations
- **JOIN Optimization:** Recommend optimal JOIN order and conditions
- **LIMIT Clauses:** Suggest adding limits for exploratory queries

### Story 6: Multi-Step Query Building
**As a** business user  
**I want to** build complex queries through multiple conversation steps  
**So that** I can create sophisticated analyses incrementally

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Support for iterative query refinement
- Ability to add filters, columns, or calculations to existing queries
- Context awareness of previous query components
- Visual representation of query building steps
- Option to combine multiple simple queries into complex analysis

**Multi-Step Examples:**
1. "Show me sales by product category" → Basic GROUP BY query
2. "Add profit margins to that" → Add calculated column
3. "Filter to only Q4 2023" → Add date filter
4. "Sort by highest profit margin" → Add ORDER BY clause

---

### Story 7: Query Templates and Patterns
**As a** business user  
**I want to** access pre-built query templates for common business questions  
**So that** I can quickly generate standard reports and analyses
