Turns out, I just had to reset the 'dock' process. I opened Terminal and typed

killall Dock
and pressed enter. The screen flashed for a second, and everything came back with my stuck icon gone.

If that fails, the issue may be with Finder (this is the case with the similar issue of Stacks categories "burned in" to your desktop background). Running

killall Finder
will address that.

Analysis
The error message indicates that the query is attempting to access a column that does not exist in the "contract_parq_policies" database. This could be due to a mismatch between the column names in the query and the actual column structure of the database table.
Resolution
Try the following steps to resolve your error:


Navigate to the Athena console in the AWS Management Console

Select the 'contract_parq_policies' database from the database dropdown

Click on the 'Tables' tab to view the tables in the database

Locate the table you're trying to query and click on it to view its schema

Compare the column names in your query with the actual column names in the table schema

If there's a mismatch, modify your query to use the correct column names

If the column you're trying to access doesn't exist in the table:

Check if you're querying the correct table
If the column should exist, verify if there have been any recent changes to the table structure
If you don't have permissions to view the table schema:

If you don't have permissions to do the following changes, contact your AWS Administrator
Request the administrator to grant you the following permissions for the specific Athena workgroup and database:
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "athena:GetTableMetadata",
    "glue:GetTable",
    "glue:GetDatabases"
  ],
  "Resource": [
    "arn:aws:athena:us-east-1:695233770948:workgroup/*",
    "arn:aws:glue:us-east-1:695233770948:catalog",
    "arn:aws:glue:us-east-1:695233770948:database/contract_parq_policies",
    "arn:aws:glue:us-east-1:695233770948:table/contract_parq_policies/*"
  ]
}
After making the necessary changes, retry your query in the Athena Query Editor

Is this resolution helpful?

referencing the 'Comprehensive Contract Analytics Dataset (contract_analytics_complete.csv)' file you generated and subsequent 'Second Script (comprehensive_contract_data.py) generated for 1000 records.  I want you to create a real world. business scenario where perhaps not all of those columns reside in a single file.  the end user in this scenario may have to use sql join, append, union statements to tie the data together.  parse the information you already provided (DO NOT ADD any additional columns, etc) and create a number of files likely to originate as separate entities.  For ex.  here are 3 images for orders, products, customer_id that a customer may have to join datasets to then perform some query analysis downstream.  I want use to look at the columns you identified and determine which you think may exist as separate files.  I don't want you to create a lot of individual files.  use your best judgement on a number of files that a customer may typically see for joining to extract or perform data analysis.

Create implementation roadmap with clear milestones
Define success metrics for self-service adoption


Business Context:
Customer seeks comprehensive self-service reporting solution where business users can interact with data through natural language, eliminating SQL knowledge requirements. Current limitation of no native Q support in QuickSight presents opportunity for alternative AI-assisted query development approach.  Architecture encompasses QuickSight/Athena backend with perhaps a Streamlit chat interface for query generation.

Self-Service Reporting Platform Goals:
-- Develop a system that empowers business users to generate their own reports
-- Reduce dependency on the development team for report creation
-- Target: Enable business users to fulfill approximately 80-89% of their reporting needs independently

Opportunity Assessment:
Leverage Q CLI/Kiro as development and business accelerator tool 

where developers can:
-Generate initial complex SQL queries through natural language prompts
-Refine and optimize generated queries for Athena compatibility
-Create reusable query templates for future view development

where business users can:
--Enable natural language to SQL conversion for non-technical users
--Support interactive data exploration without SQL expertise
--Facilitate rapid report generation through conversational interface

Next Steps: Build SQL queries and streamlit application. Schedule customer review meeting to discuss optimization and ensure alignment with their usage needs.  Improve business user self-service capability.



Prompt.md

Your Role: You are an expert product manager and are tasked with creating well defined user stories that becomes the contract for developing the system as mentioned in the Task section below. Plan for the work ahead and write your steps in an md file (user_stories_plan.md) with checkboxes for each step in the plan. If any step needs my clarification, add a note in the step to get my confirmation. Do not make critical decisions on your own. Upon completing the plan, ask for my review and approval. After my approval, you can go ahead to execute the same plan one step at a time. Once you finish each step, mark the checkboxes as done in the plan. Store all files you generate in a directory called 01_user_stories and use a numbering and naming convention to make it easy for a human being to understand the structure.

Your Task: Create simple user stories that will help me build a streamlit application with a chat interface that will allow users to use natural language to build SQL queries for an Amazon Athena database. Do not add any additional topics that are not in the scope.
