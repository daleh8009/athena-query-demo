## Slide 2: The Business Challenge
**Title:** Breaking Down Data Silos in Enterprise Analytics

**Key Points:**
- 📊 **80% of business users** can't access data without IT support
- ⏱️ **Average query request**: 3-5 days from business to insights
- 💰 **$2.1M annual cost** of delayed data-driven decisions per enterprise
- 🔒 **Data democratization gap**: Technical skills vs. business needs

**Visual:** Simple diagram showing:
```
Business User Question → IT Request → SQL Development → Results
     (Minutes)              (Days)         (Hours)        (Finally!)
```

**Speaker Notes:**
- Start with relatable pain point - everyone has waited for IT to pull data
- Emphasize the cost of delayed decisions in fast-moving markets
- Set up the problem that AI/NLP can solve

## Slide 4: AIDLC Integration in Software Development
**Title:** AI-Driven Development Lifecycle (AIDLC) - Accelerating Innovation

**Traditional vs. AIDLC Workflow:**

**Traditional Development:**
```
Requirements → Design → Code → Test → Deploy → Maintain
   (Weeks)      (Days)   (Days)  (Days)  (Hours)   (Ongoing)
```

**AIDLC-Enhanced Development:**
```
AI-Assisted Requirements → Smart Code Generation → Automated Testing → Intelligent Deployment
        (Hours)                    (Minutes)            (Automated)         (Self-Optimizing)
```

**AIDLC Benefits:**
- 🚀 **70% faster development** cycles
- 🎯 **Reduced human error** through AI validation
- 📚 **Continuous learning** from user interactions
- 🔄 **Self-improving systems** based on usage patterns

**Speaker Notes:**
- Connect this specific demo to broader AIDLC principles
- Emphasize how AI doesn't replace developers but amplifies their capabilities
- Show how this query generator exemplifies AIDLC in action
