- **Immediate deployment** - no setup required
- **Enterprise-grade security** with existing IAM roles
- **Production-ready** with your current infrastructure
- **One-click QuickSight dataset creation** (assumes QS already setup)

### **Configuration:**
```
AWS Account ID: 695233770948
Athena Results Bucket: aws-athena-query-results-us-east-1-695233770948
Glue Database: s3-athena-glue-enterprise-analytics-db
Raw Data Location: s3://s3-glue-athena-demo-archive/contracts/
```

### **Advantages:**
✅ **Zero setup time** - works with existing infrastructure  
✅ **Production ready** - uses enterprise-grade configurations  
✅ **Immediate ROI** - business users can start querying immediately
